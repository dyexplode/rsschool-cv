## About me
Programming is part of a hobby. 
My main hobby is radio engineering (working with microcontrollers). 
I am a chemist-engineer-technologist by profession.
I want to learn developing high-quality web applications.

## Skills
* Programming languages
    + Delphi
    + C
    + SQL
    + Python
    + Visual Basic for Application (VBA)

## Sample code
```
def shell_sort(data: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    last_index = len(data) - 1
    step = len(data)//2
    while step > 0:
        for i in range(step, last_index + 1, 1):
            j = i
            delta = j - step
            while delta >= 0 and data[delta] > data[j]:
                data[delta], data[j] = data[j], data[delta]
                j = delta
                delta = j - step
        step //= 2
    return data
```


## Work experiance
In process learning on course "JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0" of RS School I make some projects:
- [My CV](https://dyexplode.github.io/rsschool-cv/ "The first project in course")
- [Portfolio](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/dyexplode-JSFEPRESCHOOL/portfolio/ "Make this project from Figma pattern")
- [Eco-sounds](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/dyexplode-JSFEPRESCHOOL/eco-sounds/ "Learn to work with audio in Javascript")
- [Game three in row](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/dyexplode-JSFEPRESCHOOL/random-game/ "I like this game")

As an example, a website written in delphi 7.
